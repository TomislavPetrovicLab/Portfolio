# Basic Arithmetic Operators

friends = 50

# friends = friends + 1
# augmented assignment operator - they take less text and easier to read
# friends += 1

# friends = friends - 2
# friends -= 2
# friends = friends * 3
# firends *= 3
# friends = friends / 2
# Exponent operator "**":
# friends = friends ** 2
# friends **= 2
# print(friends)

# Modulus operator "%":
#remainder = friends % 6

#print(remainder)
